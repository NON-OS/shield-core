//! BIP39 mnemonics and BIP32/BIP44 hierarchical key derivation for the NONOS
//! keyring capsule. Everything is `no_std`, allocation-free and from scratch:
//! SHA-256, SHA-512, HMAC-SHA512 and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (the real 2048 rounds)
//! live in this crate, proven on the host against the official BIP39 and BIP32
//! test vectors. The one primitive not implemented here is secp256k1 scalar
//! multiplication: non-hardened derivation takes the parent public key from a
//! caller-supplied provider, which inside the capsule is `nonos_secp256k1`
//! and in host tests is the audited k256 crate. That provider used to be the
//! kernel's `crypto_secp256k1_pubkey` syscall; the curve left ring 0, since it
//! had no in-kernel caller and served only the wallet. Secret intermediates
//! are wiped with volatile writes on every path.
